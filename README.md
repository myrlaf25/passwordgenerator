## My Task

Starter code was provided for this assignment to create an application that will enable the user to generate a random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. I decided to try building it with some changes to it. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

#The Javascript 
 
The random password will include symbols, numeric characters, lower case characters, and upper case characters. 

The password Generator was created with check boxes that the user may select if they want those characters in there password. There is also a slider that allows to determine the length of the password, which will be between 8-128 characters long. 

I was able to link my variable with the HTML classes, IDs, etc with document.getElementById. I also created event listeners that allowed the password generator to be more interactive. The eventListener listens for a submit event and then carries out an action. 

I also included a preventDefault that would prevent the page to default and refreshing the browser onse the button was clicked. 

I decided to use the ASCII Character Sheet in order to prevent writing extensive arrays. It was used to generate the password byy assigning the range of characters to each variable containing the type of characters to include in the password. 

Most of the work was completed on Javascript. I made comments to the code as I was working on it. 

I look forward for your feedback and to imrpoving as time goes by.
